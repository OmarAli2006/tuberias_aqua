# Underground Pipeline Structural Design Calculator

A specialized engineering tool for structural analysis and design of buried pipelines.

## Features

This program performs comprehensive structural calculations for underground pipelines, including:

- Deflection analysis
- Buoyancy calculations
- Ring compression assessment 
- Buckling analysis

## Overview

This tool helps engineers and designers ensure the structural integrity of buried pipelines by analyzing key mechanical behaviors and failure modes. It takes into account various factors such as:

- Soil conditions and backfill properties
- Pipeline material characteristics
- Installation depth and conditions
- Groundwater levels
- External loads

## Calculations

The program performs the following critical analyses:

### Deflection
- Calculates vertical and horizontal pipe deformation
- Considers soil-structure interaction
- Evaluates long-term deflection effects

### Buoyancy
- Determines uplift forces
- Calculates required counterweight or anchoring
- Analyzes flotation potential in high water table conditions

### Ring Compression
- Evaluates circumferential stress
- Analyzes pipe wall compression
- Checks structural capacity against applied loads

### Buckling
- Assesses critical buckling pressure
- Evaluates stability under external loads
- Considers combined loading effects
